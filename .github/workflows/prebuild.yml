# DevContainer Image Pre-Build and Cache
# =============================================================================
# Builds and caches the DevContainer image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
# This workflow is for LOCAL DevContainer usage, NOT for GitHub Codespaces.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Pre-builds DevContainer image with Homebrew and dependencies
#   - Pushes to GHCR for faster local VS Code DevContainer rebuilds
#   - Shares cached image across team members
#
# GitHub Codespaces Prebuilds:
#   GitHub Codespaces has its OWN separate prebuild system configured via:
#   Settings → Codespaces → Set up prebuild (Repository Settings UI)
#
#   When you enable Codespaces Prebuilds in Settings, GitHub automatically:
#   1. Creates a managed workflow (.github/workflows/prebuild_*.yml)
#   2. Builds and caches the environment on push/schedule
#   3. Provides ~30 second startup vs 10-20 minute fresh builds
#
#   This workflow is complementary but separate from Codespaces Prebuilds.
#
# Benefits of This Workflow:
#   - Faster local DevContainer rebuilds (shared GHCR cache)
#   - Team members pull pre-built image instead of building from scratch
#   - CI/CD can use the same pre-built environment
#   - Architecture locked to x86_64/amd64 for Homebrew bottles
