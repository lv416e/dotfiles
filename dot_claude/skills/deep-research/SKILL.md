# Deep Research Skill

This skill provides a systematic approach to conducting thorough research on any topic.

## Purpose

Enable Claude to perform comprehensive research by:
1. Breaking down complex topics into researchable components
2. Using multiple information sources (web search, documentation, academic sources)
3. Applying critical thinking to synthesize findings
4. Presenting well-structured, evidence-based conclusions

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when users request:
- "Deep research on [topic]"
- "Comprehensive analysis of [subject]"
- "Investigate [topic] thoroughly"
- "Research the latest information about [subject]"
- "Gather detailed information on [topic]"

**Example Topics:**
- AI agent evaluation metrics and methodologies
- Latest AI/ML news and developments
- Technology stack comparisons
- Market analysis and trends
- Academic literature reviews
- Best practices for specific domains

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Scoping & Planning

**Define Research Objectives:**
- Identify core questions to answer
- Determine scope and boundaries
- List key areas to investigate
- Establish success criteria

**Plan Information Sources:**
- Web search for current information
- Documentation (Context7) for technical details
- Academic/industry sources for authoritative information
- Community resources (GitHub, forums) for practical insights

### Phase 2: Information Gathering

**Multi-Source Search Strategy:**

1. **Broad Overview Search**
   - Use general web search for landscape understanding
   - Identify key terms, concepts, and authorities
   - Note publication dates for recency

2. **Targeted Deep Dives**
   - Search specific sub-topics identified in overview
   - Look for:
     - Official documentation
     - Academic papers
     - Industry reports
     - Expert opinions
     - Case studies
     - Code examples (when relevant)

3. **Documentation Lookup**
   - Use Context7 for library-specific documentation
   - Check official API references
   - Review changelog and release notes

4. **Cross-Reference Validation**
   - Verify claims across multiple sources
   - Check for consensus vs. outlier opinions
   - Note conflicts or controversies

### Phase 3: Critical Analysis

**Apply Critical Thinking:**

- **Source Credibility**
  - Evaluate author authority
  - Check publication/organization reputation
  - Consider potential biases
  - Verify publication dates for currency

- **Evidence Quality**
  - Distinguish facts from opinions
  - Look for empirical data
  - Assess methodology rigor
  - Check for reproducibility

- **Logical Coherence**
  - Identify logical fallacies
  - Check argument consistency
  - Evaluate reasoning chains
  - Note assumptions

- **Practical Relevance**
  - Assess real-world applicability
  - Consider implementation challenges
  - Evaluate cost-benefit tradeoffs
  - Identify gaps or limitations

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Presentation

**Structure Findings:**

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Key findings (3-5 bullet points)
   - Main conclusions
   - Critical insights

2. **Detailed Analysis**
   - Organized by theme or component
   - Evidence from multiple sources
   - Comparative analysis where applicable
   - Technical details as needed

3. **Practical Implications**
   - Actionable recommendations
   - Implementation considerations
   - Risk factors
   - Next steps

4. **Source Attribution**
   - Cite all major sources
   - Link to original materials
   - Note publication dates
   - Indicate confidence levels

**Output Format:**

```markdown

## Special Considerations

### For AI/ML Topics

- Check multiple perspectives (academic, industry, open-source)
- Look for benchmarks and evaluation metrics
- Review code implementations when available
- Consider ethical implications
- Note limitations and biases

### For Current Events/News

- Use recent search results (last 30 days)
- Cross-reference multiple news sources
- Distinguish reporting from opinion
- Note evolving situations
- Check for updates

### For Technical Evaluations

- Review official documentation first
- Look for community experiences
- Check GitHub issues/discussions
- Find performance benchmarks
- Assess maturity and support

### For Business/Strategy Topics
